# Sales-Dashboard-Atomic-Design-with-Next.js-15
A modern, component-driven web application built using Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, following the Atomic Design principle. This dashboard visualizes mock sales data for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, with charts powered by Recharts and data inspired by public datasets (e.g., Kaggle).

Sales Visualization: Displays mock sales data across three years using interactive charts.

Chart Components: Modular chart components built with Recharts (Bar, Line, Pie).

Dashboard Page: A dedicated dashboard layout to host all visual components.

Mock Data Integration: Uses sample sales data (can be swapped with real API later).

ðŸ”§ Enhancements (Optional)
Custom Filter Input: Allow users to set a sales threshold to filter data dynamically.

API Integration: Replace mock data with real-time API responses.

Chart Switching: Toggle between chart types using UI buttons.
